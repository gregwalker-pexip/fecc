# Getting started

From a Pexip meeting (VMR), connect (add participant) to a video system supporting Far End Camera Control (FECC) and utilise control to select (& spotlight) a video room.

Then use arrow keys (Left\Right\Up\Down) to chnage the camera position.  Use mouse scroll to zoom In and Out.

Ensure camera tracking is disabled on room otherwise camera control is not available.

Requires Pexip API version 18.  Run **Yarn** to update the package and version.
